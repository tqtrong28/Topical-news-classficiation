# Topical-news-classficiation

In the digital era, the volume of textual data generated daily by online news outlets (such as VnExpress, Dan Tri) is increasing exponentially. Managing this massive influx of information has become a significant challenge for media platforms and content aggregators.Therefore, an automated system capable of accurately classifying text into predefined topics is essential.

The dataset employed in this study was constructed by collecting Vietnamese news articles from two prominent online media outlets: VnExpress and Dân Trí. These sources were selected due to their high reliability, standardized format, and popularity in Vietnam, ensuring a representative sample of modern Vietnamese journalism.

The dataset comprises a total of 6,162 samples. Each sample consists of 9 features (columns), containing information such as the article title, content, publication date, and URL. A significant advantage of this dataset is its balanced distribution among the four classes (ranging from 1,441 to 1,622 articles per topic), which mitigates the risk of class imbalance during the model training phase.
